I make hard things look easy.

Not because I'm special—nobody is. But because I've spent years learning to translate: between engineers and humans, between complex systems and simple experiences, between what's technically possible and what actually matters.

I've managed platforms that process millions of transactions, built workflows from chaos, and learned that most people don't care about your stack. They care whether your product lets them move through their lives without friction.

I've also made films. Watched how stories live in people's heads. Understood that the best technology disappears—you don't think about the design, you just use it. That's the job.

The last five years I stepped back. Watched systems. Learned how to see patterns others miss. It wasn't lost time. It was the opposite.

Now I'm here because the problems worth solving are at the intersection of AI, product, and human understanding. Where the technology has to become invisible because the human experience is what matters.

I'm looking for work that builds toward that. PM roles, product strategy, teams thinking in systems and empathy at the same time.

If that sounds like something you're building—let's talk.
